# WebDev
the read me for the webdev project. we can put ideas or whatever here it doesn't really matter.



**update: 3/12/18 --- I uploaded html and css of a calendar that we can work off of. this is just something I did to give us a visual while we are working.


**update: 3/14/18 --- I made the calendar in python using the calendar library and it was much easier and formatted as a table which allowed for a border unlike the list in html. from here i think we have a pretty good base to start adding functionalities.
